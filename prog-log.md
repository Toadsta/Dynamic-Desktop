What I Want To Do
=================
Like MacOS I want to use a .heic file, to set a dynamically changing wallpaper on Windows or Gnome.

Steps I will need to figure out - How to extract .heic to multiple images

Plan
====
Figure out how to set windows wallpaper on python3.10

Figure out how to extract .heic images to multiple pngs and save to one location

Figure out how to rotate images based on time of day

Build either a GUI or CLI for this application - not to autostart

Finally make it an autostart application that runs anytime pc turns on
